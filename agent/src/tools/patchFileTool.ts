- <<<<<<< SEARCH (7 < characters + SEARCH) is the start of the search content.

Rules:
- Read the file content before patching it.
- Content is searched as an exact match including indentation and line breaks.
- The first match found will be replaced if there are multiple matches.
- Use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to replace multiple contents.
